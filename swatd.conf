# The number of sensors that must 'fail' at the same time.

# The command to execute when 'threshold' sensors fail.

# Sensor commands.
# A sensor has 'failed' when the exit code transisions from zero to non-zero.
# If a sensor's exit code is transitions from zero to 255, the command will be 
# executed immediately regardless of the 'threshold' setting, and the failure
# count will not be incremented.
# WARNING: Sensor commands MUST terminate.
